Introduction
============

The purpose of the xlingualNER system is to tag sentences of various languages with our fine-grained NER labels.
The result this system, will be a file with the word on the left, and the tag on the right, space seperated.
In the future, we hope this system will support more languages and also have increased accuracy.

The current endpoint for the xlingualNER is ``https://seaword.seasalt.ai/ner/``.

Implementation
--------------
The input of the xlingualNER pipeline is a sentence of any supported language, and the output example is listed further below. 

The labels are as follows:

PERSON
    Identifies the first names, last names, family names, unique nicknames of people and fictional characters. Generational markers (Jr., IV) are included in the extent, while personal and occupational titles such as Ms., Dr., President, Secretary are NOT included.

    - Example:  Mitt Romney[PERSON] is a politician

Example 
-------

The following english sentence is submitted to the system:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "text": "In the World War(1914–1918) the First Çanakkale was a battle area. Millions died in this war."
    }

The system outputs three key elements which are a list of named entity tags at a token level, datetime grounding and miscellaneous information such as Email, URL and IP-address:

.. code-block:: JSON
 
    {
        "tags": [
            {
                "In": "O"
            },
            {
                "the": "B-EVENT"
            },
            {
                "World": "I-EVENT"
            },
            {
                "War": "I-EVENT"
            },
            {
                "(": "O"
            },
            {
                "1914–1918": "B-DATE"
            },
            {

    }


Language Support
================

The Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition API currently supports 9 languages. 
The input language following a convention of ``{lang_code}-{country_code}`` is specified via a query parameter when calling the demo endpoint.

While we intent to add more language support in the future, the following language codes are currently supported

====================  =====
Language              Code
====================  =====
English               en-XX, en-US, en-GB, en-AU, en-SG
Traditional Chinese   zh-TW
Simplifed Chinese     zh-CN
Indonesian            id-ID
Javanese              jv-ID
Malay                 ms-MY
Tagalog               tl-PH
Vietnamese            vi-VN
Czech                 cs-CZ
Croation              hr-HR
====================  =====

API usage
=========

POST /extract
-------------

To tag named-entities of a sentence, send a POST request to the ``/extract`` endpoint.
Additionally, the language must be specified as a query parameter in the URL.

.. code-block:: bash

    POST https://seaword.seasalt.ai/ner/{lang_code}/extract?access_token={api_key}

The endpoint tags a list of named entities from the input sentences. The required request body for Named Entity Recognition requires only the following fields:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "text": "string"
    }

Once the Named Entity tagging has been performed on the full sentence, you will get the following result:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "tags": "List",
        "datetime": "List",
        "misc": "Dict"
    }

In this result the ``tags`` field represents the final tagged named entities, ``datetime`` is a list of datetime grounding that appears in the input sentence, ``misc`` is a dictionary contains Email, URL and IP-address extracted from the input sentence.
