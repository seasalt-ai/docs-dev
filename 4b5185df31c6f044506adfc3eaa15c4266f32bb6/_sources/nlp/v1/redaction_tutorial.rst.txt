Introduction
============

The purpose of the Redaction is to create a self-serve interface that helps you protect all private or sensitive information in text data.
The result of running the redaction over text input(s) are redacted texts with clear labels of personally identifiable or sensitive information.

The URL for Redaction service is ``https://seaword.seasalt.ai/redact``.


Multilingual Support
====================

The Redaction Service currently supports two languages, English and Traditional Chinese. One can switch language from the selection menu on the left.

3. Choose Redaction Format

Currently, we support the following redaction format. The redacted texts will be labeled and highlighted in the respective format in the final Review section.
    
    - No mask (Label the text, and show original text)
    - Full mask (Label the text, and replace original text with `x`)
    - Tail mask (Label the text, and replace first letter with `x`)
    - Mirror mask (Label the text, and replace the second half of text with the first half)
