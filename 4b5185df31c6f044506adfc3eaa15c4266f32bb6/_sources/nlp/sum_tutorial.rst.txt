The endpoint for the Summarization API is ``https://seachat-backstage.seasalt.ai/summarization``.

All of the following API calls can be viewed and tested with the `Swagger docs <https://seachat-backstage.seasalt.ai/summarization/docs#/>`_ for this API.

The current summarization models are stored in the Azure fileshare at ``/mnt/models/nlp/summarization``.


Multilingual Support
====================

The Summarization API currently supports four languages, English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Indonesian. All API calls for each language include a language code in the URL.

The language codes for supported languages are the following:

====================  =====
Language              Code
====================  =====
English               en-XX
Traditional Chinese   zh-TW
Simplified Chinese    zh-CN
Indonesian            id-XX
====================  =====

Inference
==========

The Sumamrization API supports two types of transcript summarization, short and long. The short summary method is intended to summarize a single utterance from a transcript, to provide fine-grained summarization of the transcript. The long summary method is intended to summarize the entire transcript in large chunks, to provide an overall summary of the transcript.

Short Summary
--------------

The short summary model produces a summary of a single turn of a transcript.

This process is called with the following POST request:

.. code-block:: bash

    POST https://seachat-backstage.seasalt.ai/summarization/{lang_code}/short/summarize
    
The required request body for inference contains a single turn from a transcript in the following format:

.. code-block:: JSON

   {
        "transcription": "You know, in planning and all kinds of different meetings with the Taiwan team, and I get I got started on the MDA proposal."
    }

A successful response returns the summary of the transcription in the following JSON format.

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "summarization": "You know that there are many meetings with the Taiwan team and I get started on the MDA proposal."
    }

.. NOTE:: As summaries of extremely short utterances are not informative, if the utterances is shorter than 5 words, the summarizer will return an empty summary. To avoid going over the model's character limit, the summarizer will also truncate any utterance longer than 700 words.


Long Summary
-------------

The long summary model produces a summary of the largest possible segment of a transcript. 

This process is called with the following POST request:

.. code-block:: bash

    POST https://seachat-backstage.seasalt.ai/summarization/{lang_code}/long/summarize

The required request body for inference contains the entire transcipt in the following format, with speakers and utterances in the ``data`` list. The ``url`` element is the callback url where the final summary will be returned.

.. code-block:: JSON
    
    {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5002/result",
        "data": [
            {
                "speaker": [
                    "Speaker"
                    ],
                "transcription": "Yesterday was pretty smooth day."
            },
            {
                "speaker": [
                    "Speaker"
                    ],
                "transcription": "Many spent the time in the."
            },
            {
                "speaker": [
                    "Speaker"
                    ],
                "transcription": "You know, in planning and all kinds of different meetings with the Taiwan team, and I get I got started on the MDA proposal."
            },
            {
                "speaker": [
                    "Speaker"
                    ],
                "transcription": "Then you chat about a proposal on the Air Force Recruitment Center and today I continue to work on the proposal."
            }
        ]
    }

.. IMPORTANT:: As it takes a comparatively long time to summarize a long segment, this is implemented as a callback. A successful response will return a success message of the process starting, not a summary directly.

The transcipt will be automatically segmentented into the largest chunks possible under 300 words. The callback function will then start producing summaries. When the summarization is complete, a PUT request will be sent with the generated summary to the callback url provided in the original request body.

The final summaries will appear in the following JSON format:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "summarization": "Yesterday was a busy day for Speaker. He had many meetings with the Taiwan team and he worked on the MDA proposal. Today he continues to work on the proposal."
    }

The long summarization processing time will vary depending on the length of the transcript, as it depends on how many <300 word segments there are in the transcript.
