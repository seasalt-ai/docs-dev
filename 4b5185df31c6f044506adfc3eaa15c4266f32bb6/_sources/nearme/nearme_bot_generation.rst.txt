Bot Generation
==============

When a new bot is created for the first time via the NearMe site, the following steps are executed on the backend:

1. If it's a custom location: Find the business' Google Maps page and run the scraper to get the basic business info, reviews, hours, location, attributes, etc.

2. If it's a GBP authorized location: Use the Google Business Profile API to get all business info, reviews, hours, location, attributes, etc.

3. Store all business info in the backend DB (``ngchat-dev``, ``ngchat-staging``, ``ngchat-production``)

4. Create a brand and agent using the GBM APIs

Once these intial setup steps are completed, the user can go to the ``Local Testing`` tab and click the ``Build`` button.
This will send a POST request to the NLP Bot Generation API at ``https://seachat.seasalt.ai/bot-actions/nearme_bots``.
The NLP server will then register the business information to the ``nearme_bots`` table in the NLP database (``nlp-{namespace}``), generate FAQs based on the business attributes, and inject the FAQs, Reviews, and Additional Context into the appropriate ElasticSearch indices. 
The final important step is that an entry will also be added to the ``agent_deployment_env`` table in the ``gbm_agent_env`` database.
This table associates a particular GBM agent with a bot in the appropriate deployment environment to ensure proper routing of incoming messages.
More on that in the Bot Routing section.

Once the NLP server is done, the user can immediately scan the QR code on the screen to talk to the bot.
Additionally, the build process will also trigger the endpoint POST ``https://seachat.seasalt.ai/bot-actions/nearme_bots/{bot_id}/flyer``, which will create a customized marketing flyer for our team to use when approaching the business.

For more detailed information about the endpoints used, refer to the swagger docs: https://seachat.seasalt.ai/bot-actions/docs 
   

Data Storage
------------

The NLP team maintains separate DBs from the backend team for all of the bot data that is necessary to keep the bots running.
At bot generation time, we store important business & bot data to the ``nlp-dev``, ``nlp-staging``, or ``nlp-production`` database in the ``nearme_bots`` table.
The table has the following format: 

**nearme_bots**
