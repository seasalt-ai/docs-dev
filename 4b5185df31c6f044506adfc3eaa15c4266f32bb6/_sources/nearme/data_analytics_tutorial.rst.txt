Introduction
============

The purpose of this data analytics pipeline with Google Data Studio is to be able to generate insights from any big JSON file for the sales team. The current JSON files that we have consist of information about businesses in Seattle, Vancouver, and Singapore. This information includes names of businesses, latitude, longitude, website, ratings, reviews, attributes, and more.

Implementation
--------------

This data analytics pipeline include two steps:

Step 1. Preprocess JSON file

Firstly, we have to preprocess the JSON file and generate csv files. You can download the JSON files from the Google Drive. Then, we use the `generate_csv_files.py` script in the `data-studio-analytics` folder of NearMe repo. To run the script, please follow the steps below. 


.. code-block:: bash

   $ chmod +x generate_csv_files.py
   $ ./generate_csv_files.py [path to input file] [path to output file for map and attributes] [path to output file for time series]

This script will generate two csv files: 1) one csv file that consists of information for data studio map and attributes graph 2) one csv file specifically for time series graph. The CSV files are divided into two files due to file size limit of 100 MB on Data Studio.


Step 2. Upload the CSV files to the Google Data Studio

Once we have the CSV files, we can go to the `Data Studio report <https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/72ec276d-f15a-4976-8a99-ed1183868453>`_. There, we should change the data source by clickling the graph and hover to the right upper corner of the report. You will see a data source of the graph (shown below). Change the data source to your newly generated CSV files. You should do so for all the graphs on the report.

.. NOTE:: You should only use the time series csv file on the two time series graphs and use the other csv file for all the other filters and graphs.

.. NOTE:: If the map does not show the businesses properly, make sure to check the field type for `coordinates` field. The format has to be `geo/latitude, longitude`
